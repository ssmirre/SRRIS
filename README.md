# Project SRRIS
## Introduction
In this program, we have classified the diseases using a limited list of the main symptoms and then, by receiving more information from the patient, we examine the patient's likelihood of infection.
We also provide the patient with a treatment plan, along with the things that are best to do or avoid, and how long the disease may last.

It should be noted that diagnosing a disease requires medical tests, imaging (ultrasound, etc.), and also considering the underlying conditions of each patient according to age and gender. Therefore, since nothing is certain in medical science, the patient must definitely consult a doctor in case of acute conditions and avoid taking medications on his own.
Overall, this program guides the patient to get out of confusion and see a doctor.


## File management system
This project was done by a team, and is available in English and Persian. You can find the initial code done by each team memeber in both languages in the folders titled with the targetted language.

The final version is edited by S. Shokri, available under the name "SRRIS Final version.py".
